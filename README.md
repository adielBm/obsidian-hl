- based on https://github.com/typhoon-kim/obsidian-svelte-syntax-highlighter.
- obsidian plugin that provides syntax highlighting (in code blocks) for some languages are not supported by default. using Prism.js highlighting engine.
- currently added languages:
  - `mips` (MIPS Assembly) language.
  - you can add more languages by: 
    - adding `<language>.ts` file in `languages` directory (like `languages/mips.ts`).
    - register the language in `main.ts` file here: https://github.com/adielBm/obsidian-hl/blob/1688a7813b1131a96f1ec73141904b870b880618/main.ts#L26-L32
